## Why is my spec empty?

This usually means no controllers were discovered from the entry module.

- `files.entry` must point to a file that exports a class decorated with `@Module`
- That module must list controllers in `@Module({ controllers: [...] })`
- Controllers provided only by dynamic module factories (for example `SomeModule.forRoot(...)`) are not statically resolved

Run with `--debug` to see resolved entry paths and debug logs.

## Path aliases are not resolved

`files.tsconfig` is required and must point to the tsconfig that defines your `baseUrl` and `paths`. If you use a separate build or test tsconfig, make sure you point at the one that matches your source layout.

```ts
// openapi.config.ts
files: {
  entry: 'src/app.module.ts',
  tsconfig: 'tsconfig.json',
}
```

## DTOs are not discovered

By default, schemas are generated from types referenced in controller signatures. If you have DTOs used only indirectly or not referenced at all, add `dtoGlob` and make sure the DTO types are exported.

```ts
files: {
  entry: 'src/app.module.ts',
  dtoGlob: 'src/**/*.dto.ts',
}
```

## Security decorators do not show up

Decorators only add security requirements. Schemes must be defined in `openapi.security.schemes`, or the requirements will reference missing scheme names.

```ts
openapi: {
  security: {
    schemes: [
      { name: 'bearer', type: 'http', scheme: 'bearer' },
    ],
  },
}
```

## Why are my response types missing details?

Response shortcut decorators like `@ApiOkResponse()` are not supported. Use `@ApiResponse({ status: ... })` with an explicit `type`, and prefer explicit return types on controller methods.

## How do I debug generation?

Use debug or profiling flags:

```bash
npx nestjs-openapi-static generate -c openapi.config.ts --debug
```

`--debug` prints verbose logs and stack traces. `--profile` prints per-stage timings.

## Does it run in CI without the app running?

Yes. Generation is static and does not bootstrap NestJS. You can run it as part of your build pipeline.

## What about monorepos?

Paths in `openapi.config.ts` are resolved relative to the config file. In a monorepo, keep a config per package and point `files.entry`/`files.tsconfig` at that package’s paths. See the [Monorepo recipe](/docs/recipes/monorepo).
