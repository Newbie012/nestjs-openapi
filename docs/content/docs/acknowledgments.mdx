This project stands on the shoulders of excellent open source work. Thank you to all the maintainers and contributors.

## Core Dependencies

### Effect

The functional TypeScript library that powers our internal architecture. Effect provides robust error handling, composable pipelines, and type-safe concurrency. It made building reliable static analysis tooling significantly easier.

### ts-morph

A wrapper around the TypeScript compiler API that makes AST manipulation actually pleasant. Without ts-morph, navigating decorators, extracting type information, and traversing module graphs would be far more tedious.

### ts-json-schema-generator

Handles the heavy lifting of converting TypeScript types to JSON Schema. This library does the complex work of resolving generics, unions, and intersections into valid schemas.

## Documentation

### Fumadocs

The documentation framework you're reading right now. Built on Next.js, it provides excellent DX with MDX support, syntax highlighting, and a clean default theme.

### Tailwind CSS

Utility-first CSS that makes styling documentation components fast and consistent.

## Development Tools

### Vitest

Fast, TypeScript-native test runner. Made writing and running 240+ tests a breeze.

[vitest.dev](https://vitest.dev)

### unbuild

Zero-config build tool from the UnJS ecosystem. Handles dual ESM builds without fuss.

[github.com/unjs/unbuild](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild)

### ESLint & Prettier

Keeping code consistent and formatted.

## The NestJS Ecosystem

### NestJS

The framework this tool analyzes. NestJS's decorator-based architecture is what makes static analysis possible - decorators are visible in the AST.

[nestjs.com](https://nestjs.com)

### @nestjs/swagger

The official OpenAPI module. While we take a different approach, their decorator conventions define the standard we aim to support.

[docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction)

### class-validator

Validation decorators that we extract and map to OpenAPI schema constraints.
