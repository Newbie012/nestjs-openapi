A concise view of what the generator reads today. For details, see the full [Decorators Guide](/docs/guides/decorators).

## Routing

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@Controller('path')` | Supported | String path only |
| `@Controller({ path, version })` | Not supported | Object syntax is ignored |
| HTTP method decorators | Supported | `@Get`, `@Post`, `@Put`, `@Patch`, `@Delete`, `@Options`, `@Head`, `@All` (`all` is non-standard) |

## Parameters

| Decorator | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@Param()` | Supported | Path parameters |
| `@Query()` | Supported | Query params, DTOs inline by default |
| `@Body()` | Supported | Request body |
| `@Headers()` | Supported | Header parameters |

## Swagger Operation Decorators

| Decorator | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@ApiTags` | Supported | Controller and method level |
| `@ApiOperation` | Supported | Summary, description, operationId |
| `@ApiParam` | Supported | Path parameter docs |
| `@ApiQuery` | Supported | Query parameter docs |
| `@ApiBody` | Supported | Body metadata |
| `@ApiResponse` | Supported | `status` is required |
| `@ApiExcludeEndpoint` | Supported | Method-level, controlled by `excludeDecorators` |
| `@ApiConsumes`, `@ApiProduces` | Supported | Content types |
| `@ApiExcludeController` | Not supported | Controller-level exclusion is not applied |

## Response Shortcuts

| Decorator | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@ApiOkResponse`, `@ApiCreatedResponse`, etc. | Not supported | Use `@ApiResponse({ status: ... })` |

## Property Decorators

| Decorator | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@ApiProperty` | Not supported | Use TypeScript types + JSDoc |
| `@ApiPropertyOptional` | Not supported | Use optional properties (`?`) |
| `@ApiHideProperty` | Not supported | No equivalent |

## Security

| Decorator | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@ApiBearerAuth` | Supported | Scheme must exist in config |
| `@ApiBasicAuth` | Supported | Scheme must exist in config |
| `@ApiOAuth2` | Supported | Scheme must exist in config |
| `@ApiSecurity` | Supported | Scheme must exist in config |
| `@ApiCookieAuth` | Supported | Scheme must exist in config |

## DTO Schema Generation

| Source | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript types | Supported | Primary source of truth |
| JSDoc tags | Supported | Descriptions and constraints |
| class-validator decorators | Supported | Requires `extractValidation: true` |

## Limitations

- Dynamic route registration at runtime is not supported
- Controller versioning via `@Controller({ path, version })` is not supported
- Response shortcut decorators are ignored
- Controller-level exclusion decorators are not applied
- `@All()` maps to a non-standard `all` operation
